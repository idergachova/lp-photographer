                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <div class="text-about">
                    <p class="text-about2">My love for photography started when I began taking pictures of my children. I was fascinated by the way I could freeze a moment in time and capture a memory that would last a lifetime. As time went by, my passion for photography grew, and it became more than just a hobby for me.</p>
                    <p class="text-about2">I'm always eager to learn new techniques and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in photography. I attend master classes and workshops to develop my skills and improve my craft. Photography is not just a profession or a hobby for me; it's an art form that requires creativity, dedication, and hard work.</p>
                    <p class="text-about2">Capturing beautiful and meaningful moments for my clients is what I enjoy the most about my job. Whether it's a wedding, a family portrait, or a corporate event, I approach each assignment with the same level of passion and enthusiasm. I believe that every photograph has the power to make a lasting impression, and that's what drives me to keep pushing the boundaries of my skills as a photographer.</p>
                    <p class="text-about2">For me, every photograph tells a story, and I strive to convey those stories through my work.</p>
